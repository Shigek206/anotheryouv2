<h1>Phalloplasty Medical Tattooing</h1>

<h5>Phalloplasty procedure is the construction of a penis for female-to-male individuals.  The goal of a phalloplasty is to build a cosmetically appealing penis however, due to the donor sites (usually the thigh or forearm) the new phallus will have a different coloring and will lack the anatomical venous structures that males have in their genital area .  Tattooing the phallus and the glans can give it a more realistic color tone.  A dorsal vein can also be recreated by tattooing.</h5>

<p>After all the surgeries, let's work together to make your phalloplasty look as realistic as possible. We will decide on color variations, vein placements, and more.</p>

<p>The beauty of tattooing the penis is that no one penis is the same, and we get to create the ideal one for you. Hair follicles can be tattooed to cover any scars at the base of the shaft to blend in with natural hair. Color variation from the shaft to body will also blend smoothly.</p>

<p>Veins can be large and pronounced or tiny and spider-like. Colors can vary from bluish to reddish. Vein size, color, and placement will be the final touch on your transformation. There is usually a dorsal penile vein and then perhaps some smaller, finer veins. Usually this is perfected at the end of the series.</p>

<h3>Before the Procedure</h3>
<p>I advise clients to search for photos online and to bring the photos with them so we can get ideas for color. This procedure is very fun for me as it adds a new dimension to my work.</p>

<h3>During the Procedure</h3>
<p>Depending on your comfort level, we can start with the glans area or the shaft. The shaft can have pink tones, brown tones or a combination of the two. The glans is also a variation of light and dark browns and pinks. Color and saturation of color will be done to your preference.</p>

<p>You will be sitting up with a surgical drape over your lap. You can be as involved with the tattoo process as you feel comfortable, or you can read or play on your phone. I will periodically ask questions to make sure we are going in the right direction as far as color variation and other details.</p>

<p>The procedure can range from 2-3 hours depending on how much we want to accomplish during your first visit.</p>

<h3>After the Procedure</h3>
<p>Expect the area to look much bolder and darker with the initial tattoo. Be prepared for the area to be very swollen and quite sensitive, but the discomfort will be manageable. The swelling differs between clients and, after about a week, the color will adjust to how it will look after it heals.</p>

<p>A follow-up appointment will be made 6 - 8 weeks after your initial visit for any necessary adjustments such as more depth of color, more veins, etc. This is a progressive procedure and may take up to three visits to fully complete.</p>
