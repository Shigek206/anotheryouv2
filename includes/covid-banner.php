				<h2>COVID-19 Health & Safety</h2>
				<p>Here at Another You Permanent Cosmetics your health and safety are top priority. Given the current situation with COVID-19 and guidance from local officials, I am still unable to tattoo. The good news is this may come to an end in Phase 2 of the <a href="https://www.governor.wa.gov/sites/default/files/SafeStartWA_4May20_1pm.pdf" target="_blank">Start Safe Guidelines</a>. I am extremely excited for the time to come when I can begin tattooing again. I welcome new and past clients to come visit the new website and stay tuned for further notifications and updates! Until then, please stay safe and I will see you soon. - <strong>Danette</strong></p>
