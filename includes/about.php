<h1>Another You Permanent Cosmetics</h1>
<p>The role of today’s typical woman is very demanding. She wants a career, family, a home, and she wants to look great throughout her average sixteen hour day. With intradermal cosmetics this is no longer a fantasy, and no longer for celebrities only. Danette Proszek with Another You Permanent Cosmetics performs the cosmetic tattooing in a number of locations to better accommodate her clients - in the Medical Dental building in downtown Seattle and in the Becker Medical Building in Enumclaw in the office of Dr. Nancy Becker. She also travels to California operating out of Image Resorts in Camarillo, CA.</p>

<p>Modern permanent cosmetics are fairly recent, but the concept dates back to ancient Egypt. Over the last ten years the industry has grown rapidly in popularity.</p>

<p>There are as many different techniques and tools available to apply intradermal cosmetics as there are names for the actual process itself. “Permanent makeup, permanent cosmetics, intradermal cosmetics, micro-pigmentation,” . . . these are all names that refer to the process of placing pigment into your skin permanently, which we all commonly know as “tattooing”. The procedure is used to enhance facial features and as a finishing touch to surgical procedures.</p>

<p>Thank you for your inquiry into permanent cosmetics. I hope this information will be of help to you. If you have further questions that have not been covered in the information provided, please give me a call or send an email. I do offer a courtesy consultation so that I may sit down with you and discuss your own particular needs. Please feel free to take advantage of this. I look forward to meeting you!</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br>
