<p>It is important that the technician performing your permanent cosmetic procedure is not only knowledgeable in the medical field, but has a cosmetic and artistic background as well. A consultation should be required to allow you to discuss the information presented to you, and for your technician to evaluate the information concerning your health issues. This is a very good time for you to determine if you are "communicating" with each other. It is important that your particular individual needs are addressed at this time, but your artist and technician should also be willing to give you suggestions based on her expertise in the unique field.</p>
